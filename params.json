Think of it like a Linux-only [osquery](http://osquery.io), but with fewer and less-robust tables (but we don't require vagrant or VMs, so we got that going for us, which is nice).\r\n\r\n## Building from Source\r\n1. Building from source involves building the kernel module, loading it, and then building the user program. You can use the script `make.sh` to perform all three tasks at once, or you can use the `load.sh` and `compile.sh` scripts to perform the tasks separately. As a note, you may need to use the `chmod` command to make the scripts executable. \r\n2. Use `sudo ./kquery` to run the shell\r\n\r\n## Current Features\r\n  * `.quit` and `CTRL-D` to exit the shell\r\n  * The following tables:\r\n      * **Process**\r\n    \r\n          Column     | Type\r\n          ---------- | ----\r\n          pid        | INT PRIMARY KEY\r\n          name       | TEXT\r\n          parent_pid | INT\r\n          state      | BIGINT\r\n          flags      | BIGINT\r\n          priority   | INT\r\n          num_vmas   | INT\r\n          total_vm   | BIGINT\r\n\r\n## Future Features\r\n* Extra shell commands (`.tables`, `.schema`, etc.)\r\n* More tables\r\n\r\n## License\r\nkQuery is licensed under the [GNU General Public License, version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
